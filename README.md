Performa
Performa is a Python-based application that aggregates and visualizes historical performance data of athletes across various sports. Inspired by financial market dashboards, it presents intuitive, interactive graphs to help users analyze and compare player statistics over time.

📊 Features
Multi-Sport Data Aggregation: Collects and standardizes historical performance metrics from various sports.

Interactive Visualizations: Utilizes tools like Plotly or D3.js to create dynamic, user-friendly graphs.

Stock Market-Inspired Interface: Presents data in a format reminiscent of financial dashboards for intuitive analysis.

Cross-Sport Comparisons: Allows users to compare athletes across different sports disciplines.​

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (with libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping, Pandas for data manipulation).

Frontend: JavaScript frameworks (like React) combined with visualization libraries (like D3.js or Chart.js).

Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing aggregated data.

Deployment: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes, hosted on cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.​
